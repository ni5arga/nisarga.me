Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Nisarga](https://nisarga.me/about/). I'm a 17 year old friendly neighborhood software engineer, hacker, cybersecurity researcher, CTF player, open-source software enthusiast & high school science student. I build useless and sometimes useful projects. Whenever I'm not studying you'll find me writing code, watching anime, hacking stuff, reading books, listening to music or clicking photos. Most of my projects are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ni5arga). 

I have built 3 devvit apps (2 public) which are used across 343+ subreddits (communities on Reddit) with over 50,000,000+ members. Currently dabbling academics, programming and random cybersecurity stuff.
