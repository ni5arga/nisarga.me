Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Nisarga](https://github.com/ni5arga), an 18-year-old software engineer, CTF player, and curious mind into open-source, cybersecurity, and digital investigations. I build things for fun (and sometimes they're useful).

Outside of studying, Iâ€™m usually writing code, exploring security challenges, watching anime, reading, listening to music, or taking photos. Iâ€™ve interned with startups and non-profits in the past, and Iâ€™m currently balancing academics, programming, and whatever else catches my interest.

Most of my work is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni5arga) if youâ€™d like to check it out.
