# Nisarga
![](/images/aesthetic-discord.gif)
Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Nisarga](https://github.com/ni5arga). I'm a 18 year old friendly neighborhood software engineer, hacker, cybersecurity researcher, CTF player, open-source software enthusiast & high school science student. My interests revolve around finance, OSINT & cybersecurity. I build useless and sometimes useful projects. Whenever I'm not studying you'll find me writing code, watching anime, hacking stuff, reading books, listening to music or clicking photos. Most of my projects are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ni5arga). I'm working as a founding engineer at a startup at the moment. Currently dabbling academics, programming and random stuff I find fun.
