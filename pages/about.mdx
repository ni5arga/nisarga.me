## Who am I?

I'm no one special. I'm yet another teenager from somewhere in the world who loves computers and loves to build & hack stuff.
My pronouns are [He/Him](https://en.pronouns.page/@ni5arga). I'm a 18 year old programmer, CTF player, cybersecurity enthusiast & high school science student from India. I enjoy working with frameworks like Next.js and crafting beautiful apps & websites. Programming is my hobby, which eventually became my passion. I mostly code in Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Go & Rust. I love working on automation, APIs & robots. I love to build bots, websites, useless projects and apps! I am experienced with stuff like AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud etc. I am a huge Linux and open source software fan.
