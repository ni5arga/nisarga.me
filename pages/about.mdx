## Who am I?

I'm no one special. I'm yet another teenager from somewhere in the world who loves computers and loves to build & stuff.
My pronouns are [He/Him](https://en.pronouns.page/@ni5arga). I'm a 17 year old full stack web dev, cybersecurity enthusiast & high school science student from India. I enjoy working with frameworks like Next.js and crafting beautiful apps & websites. Programming is my hobby, which eventually became my passion. I mostly code in Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Go & Rust. I love working on automation, APIs & robots. I love to build bots, websites, useless projects and apps! I am experienced with stuff like AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud etc. I am a huge Linux and open source software fan. I ocassionally solve DSA challenges & take part in CTF competitions. I also spend my time ricing my Linux. I love to read English literature & solving math problems XD. I contribute to open source projects when I'm not busy with my studies & assignments. I also maintain some open source projects on GitHub. I love solving maths, exploring physics and watching anime apart from playing with computers and coding. I want to become a software developer, cybersecurity professional or an entrepeneur. I am currently focusing on my studies, life and academics. I believe technology can give mankind a better and brighter future.
