# A New Chapter Begins

My tenth board exams ended quite a few days ago and I have techincally graduated class 10th (well just need to wait till the result comes). I don't know why Indian parents are so hyped about this tenth board exams and all. This is an exam and it should be treated like any other exam. Being a study nerd from a really young age, I can tell that there is little to no difference in school final exams and tenth board exams. And these exams are not even that hard.

Something my life has changed, that's why this post is titled as "A New Chapter Begins". I spent 16 years of my life in the land of West Bengal but this had to change. To take a leap forward and to chase my dreams I have shifted to the heart and capital of India, New Delhi. This happened all of a sudden. Delhi is a lovely city (not to mention it's pollution, AQI & stuff). I shifted to New Delhi to take coaching for JEE (Joint Entrance Examination). I am also switiching my board and my medium. Probably a huge change in my academics. I was a Bengali medium student, now I'll become a English medium student. I was a WBBSE board student, now I will become a CBSE board student. Yeah, I am pretty sure that I'll not face any problems regarding medium-board switching.

And from a tech point of view, Delhi is a pretty good place too. Codedays, hackathons & other dev events are organized in Delhi all the time. I'll be spending my time in Delhi, in hostel, far away from my friends and family. I just convinced my parents to give me my laptop while I stay at Delhi <3

I probably won't be able to actively code as I'll have to devote 99%-100% of my time in my studies (I'm doing this so I can code for the rest of my life).

I don't know what the future holds for me, I hope it's full of joy.

That's it, wish me luck. I started this new blog to write about stuff, I previously used Medium & Hashnode but self-hosting gives more independence doesn't it?
