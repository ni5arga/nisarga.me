**What is OSINT?**

OhSINT TryHackMe Room: https://tryhackme.com/r/room/ohsint

This room is all about getting information about an user from just an image. This is a pretty simple, easy & straightforward room.

We are given this image:

![target image](https://i.imgur.com/YYwcglR.png)

windows XP memories, sigh.

**Question 1:**  What is the user's avatar of?
![q1](https://i.imgur.com/Qnn2AAl.png)

To solve this, we need to extract information from the image we were provided.

Images have metadata (text information related to the image) embedded in them. We'll use this metadata to find the info we need. To extract the EXIF/metadata from the image we will use [exiftool](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool). You can install EXIF tool by simply running:
```shell
sudo apt install exiftool
```
The installation command depends on your system, if you're on Arch Linux you'll have to run this:
```shell
sudo pacman -S perl-image-exiftool
```

> Alternative Tools or Services you can use:
> - https://exifdata.com
> - https://www.metadata2go.com
> - https://github.com/d2phap/ExifGlass


After you have successfully installed exiftool, run this command to get the required information about the image:

```shell
exiftool image.jpg
```
> note: i assumed that you have saved the file with the name "image.jpg"

This is the output

We have found the links to their [X/twitter](https://twitter.com/owoodflint?lang=en),  [GitHub](https://github.com/OWoodfl1nt) & [Blog](https://oliverwoodflint.wordpress.com/author/owoodflint/).

**Question 2:** What city is this person in?

We can see a tweet by the person where they are sharing their WiFi BSSID.

![bssid](https://i.imgur.com/QH5mOEA.png)

We'll use a site called https://wigle.net to gather info about the WiFi network.

You'll need to sign up for an account on the website.

Then navigate to View > Search > Advanced Search (https://wigle.net/search)

Now copy the BSSID you have from the tweet and paste it in the BSSID/MAC field of the search tool and hit the query button.
